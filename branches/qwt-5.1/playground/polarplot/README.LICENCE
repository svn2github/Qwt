In opposite to the Qwt library, the QwtPolar library is released under 
the GPL 2.0. The reason for this is temporarily and the Qwt licence will
be used for later releases of the QwtPolar package too.

In the meantime you need to contact the author, if you like to use it in
a closed source environment.
